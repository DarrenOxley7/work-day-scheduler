## Description

### The Task

I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

In the end I have minimal code which dynamically updates the html as I could not get everything to work and I still don't understand some of the fundamental coding principles in js/jQuery, so I have hard coded the time blocks into the html. As I progress my knowledge this code will get updated and cleaned up to make it more dynamic, but I wanted to get a working application out instead of a broken one.


## The requirements

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
